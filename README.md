[Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) is a company that specializes in
online form building. This R package allows users to download their form
results through the exposed API (V2).

## Installation

The package can be installed from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("rtypeform")
```

and loaded in the usual way.

``` r
library("rtypeform")
```

## Using this package

This package can be used with either a typeform personal access token
**or** by setting up an application and creating an OAuth access token.

A personal access token gives you full access to all of the typeform API
for your typeforms and results. Note anyone with your personal access
token can retrieve, update and delete your typeforms and data. To access
your typeform data with a personal access token see the [Personal Access
Token](#pat) section below.

When creating an application with an OAuth access token, explicit
permission for different functionality (scopes) must be granted. See the
section below on [OAuth access](#oauth).

If you have previously used the version 1 API this is now entirely
removed. You will need to generate new tokens.

### Personal Access Token

To use this package with a personal access token you need to first
obtain one. It is fairly easy to obtain one. See typeform’s [help
page](https://www.typeform.com/developers/get-started/personal-access-token/).
The token will look something like

> 943af478d3ff3d4d760020c11af102b79c440513

### OAuth Access

When you create an application that authenticates using OAuth you will
use scopes to define the extent of access to a users data. This way your
app can request a users permission to undertake actions on that users
behalf.

[This
link](https://www.typeform.com/developers/get-started/applications/)
will get you started with registering a new application on your account.

Once you have your client id and client secret you can use the
{rtypeform} package to set these as options.

``` r
rtypeform_set_client_id(my_client_id)
rtypeform_set_client_secret(my_client_secret)
```

As with the personal access token. Anyone with these details can
impersonate you to obtain, update and remove data, they should always be
kept safe.

Having set the client id and secret, before we can obtain an access
token we also need to define the scope of our application.
`rtypeform_set_scope()` takes as argument a character vector of allowed
access scopes. For more information see the scopes section below.

``` r
rtypeform_set_scope("forms:read")
```

We can then generate a new token with

``` r
api = make_new_token()
```

This will open a web browser prompting the user to give permission. The
token can be cached in a local .httr-oauth file between sessions.

### Scopes

You define the scope at the time that the access token is generated. To
discover what each scope allows access to, see
[here](https://www.typeform.com/developers/get-started/scopes/).

## Using the package

Once you have this key, (either personal access token, or an oauth token
created by `make_new_token()`) we can extract data from typeform

``` r
api = "XXXXX"
# Was get_typeforms() in V1 of the package
forms = get_forms(api)
```

The forms object is also contains attributes containing the total number
of forms.

``` r
attr(forms, "total_items")
#> [1] 476
```

If you don’t pass your `api` token as an argument, it will attempt to
read the variable `typeform_api2` from your `.Renviron` file, via
`Sys.getenv("typeform_api2")`. If this variable is set correctly, then
you can **omit** the `api` argument

``` r
# See ?get_forms for further details
forms = get_forms()
```

To set the access token for the current session you can use

``` r
rtypeform_set_token(api)
```

set (see Efficient R programming [Chapter
2](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#renviron) for
more details).

You can download data from a particular typeform via

``` r
# Most recent typeform
form_id = forms$form_id[1]
q = get_responses(form_id, completed = TRUE)
```

The object `q` is a list. The first element is `meta` that contain
details on the user, such as, their `platform` and `user_agent`. The
other list elements are responses to each question.

There are a number of options for downloading the data. For example

``` r
q = get_responses(form_id, completed = TRUE, page_size = 100)
```

See the `?get_responses` help page for other options.

### Looking at the responses

Since the responses is list, we get to perform lots of map operations. I
find using {purrr} and the {tidyverse} make this a bit easier. To see
the question types we can use string a few `map()` commands together

``` r
library("tidyverse")
question_types = q[-1] %>% # Remove the meta
   map(~select(.x, type)) %>%
   map_df(~slice(.x, 1)) %>%
   pull()
```

### Example: Multiple Filters / Order

Imagine we only want:

- completed results, so we add the parameter `completed = TRUE`.
- a maximum of 5 results, so we add the parameter `page_size = 5`.
- results since `2018-01-01 11:00:00`.

``` r
since = "2018-01-01 11:00:00"
# convert to date-time
since = lubridate::ymd_hms(since)
q = get_responses(form_id, completed = TRUE,
                  page_size = 5, since = since)
```
